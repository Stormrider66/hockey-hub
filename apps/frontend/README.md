## Quick Start with Mock Authentication

For rapid frontend development without backend:

1. Enable mock authentication in `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MOCK_AUTH=true
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to http://localhost:3002/login

4. Use the **Development Quick Login** panel to instantly log in as any user role

See [Mock Authentication Guide](./docs/MOCK_AUTH_GUIDE.md) for detailed documentation.
