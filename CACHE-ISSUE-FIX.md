# Build Cache Issue Fix

## Problem
The AgilityDisplay.tsx file has been corrected to use the proper import path:
```typescript
import { intervalTimerAudio } from '../../services/IntervalTimerAudioService';
```

But the build error still shows the old path, indicating a caching issue.

## Verification
✅ File content is correct (verified with head command)
✅ Service file exists at the correct location  
✅ Relative path is correct: `../../services/IntervalTimerAudioService`
✅ Build cache (.next folder) has been cleared

## Solution Steps

Try these steps in order:

### 1. Hard Refresh Browser
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
- Or press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### 2. Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd /mnt/c/Hockey\ Hub/apps/frontend
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Clear All Caches
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Hockey\ Hub/apps/frontend
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Force TypeScript Check
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Hockey\ Hub/apps/frontend
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### 5. Alternative: Temporary Fix
If the issue persists, you can temporarily copy the service to the expected location:
```bash
cp src/features/physical-trainer/services/IntervalTimerAudioService.ts src/features/physical-trainer/services/intervalTimerAudio.ts
```

## Root Cause
This appears to be a Next.js development server caching issue where:
- The file has been correctly updated
- But the development server is still using a cached version
- The build system hasn't detected the file change

## Expected Result
After clearing caches and restarting, the build should succeed with no import errors.
