## Development Commands

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies from root directory
pnpm install

# Build shared packages first
pnpm run build:shared
```

### Frontend
```bash
# From root directory
pnpm dev:frontend   # Start frontend development server on port 3010

# Or from frontend directory
cd apps/frontend
pnpm dev           # Start development server
pnpm build         # Build for production
pnpm lint          # Run ESLint
pnpm test          # Run tests
pnpm storybook     # Start Storybook on port 6006
```

### Running Services
```bash
# From root - run all services
pnpm dev           # Start all services in development mode

# From root - run specific service
pnpm --filter [service-name] dev

# Or from service directory
cd services/[service-name]
pnpm dev           # Start service in development mode
pnpm build         # Build service
pnpm test          # Run tests
```

## Git Workflow
- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branches: `feature/[feature-name]`
- Commit convention: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- All commits are co-authored by Claude

## Environment Variables
Each service has its own `.env` file. Frontend uses `.env.local` for local development.

## Remaining TODOs
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline ✅ (GitHub Actions configured)
- [x] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) ✅ (Complete documentation suite)
- [x] E2E testing with Cypress ✅ (200+ test cases implemented)
- [ ] Docker containerization (Dockerfiles created, compose needed)
- [ ] Production deployment configuration (PM2 ready)
- [ ] Monitoring and observability setup (Logging ready, APM needed)

## Dependencies to Note
- Using pnpm for package management
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for icons
- Radix UI for accessible components
