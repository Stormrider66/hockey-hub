## Known Issues / Risks

1.  **Authorization Complexity:** Implementing granular permissions based on roles and relationships is complex. Core check mechanism improved, but specific scopes (e.g., parent/coach listing views) still need careful implementation and testing in repositories/controllers. Need to complete resource organization check in User Service `canPerformAction`. **(Mitigation In Progress)**
2.  **Inter-Service Communication:** Still relies on direct API calls (`authzService`). Performance/reliability of sync calls vs. async events needs evaluation for other scenarios. **(Risk Accepted for Authz)**
3.  **TODO Implementation:** Several core logic pieces (intensity calc, conflict detection, Planning Service validation/auth scopes) are still placeholders or partially implemented.
4.  **Frontend Completeness:** Significant work remains to build out the different modules in the UI.
5.  **Data Consistency:** Ensuring data integrity across service boundaries (Saga pattern planned but not implemented).
6.  **Startup Order (Local Dev):** While retry logic helps, the fundamental dependency requires Docker Compose or similar for robust startup orchestration in production.
7.  **CI Test Script Implementation:** The specialized test scripts referenced in the CI workflows (e.g., `test:exercises`, `test:programs`) need to be created and maintained.

## Next Milestones

1.  **Milestone: Backend Core Logic & Refinement** (Target: 3-4 weeks)
    - Implement core TODOs (Intensity Calc, Resource Conflicts).
    - Refine authorization helper logic (`authzService.ts` / `canPerformAction`) - *Partially Done*. Complete remaining scopes & Org check.
    - Add Zod validation to remaining Planning/Training/Medical endpoints.
    - Implement remaining basic CRUD in scaffolded services.
    - Apply `authorize` middleware to secure relevant User Service endpoints.
    - Set up API Gateway routing for implemented services.
    - Implement specific test scripts referenced in CI workflows (e.g., `test:exercises`, `test:programs`, `test:perf:load`, `test:assignments`).
    - Add tests for User Service authorization endpoint/logic and `authorize` middleware.

2.  **Milestone: Foundational Frontend** (Target: 3-4 weeks remaining)
    - âœ… Implement basic Calendar UI (fetching/displaying events).
    - Connect Auth flow to User Service (Configure Providers).
    - Build core layout components using shadcn/ui (Refinement).
    - Implement basic Chat UI (listing chats, displaying messages).

3.  **Milestone: Training Module Frontend & Core Features** (Target: 4 weeks)
    - UI for Exercise Library, Templates.
    - UI for Scheduling Sessions (integrating intensity calc).
    - UI for Test Definitions & Results entry.
