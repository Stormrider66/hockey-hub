## Known Issues

As the project is in the planning phase, we don't have functional issues yet, but we have identified some potential challenges:

1. **Complexity in Service Integration**
   - Need to carefully plan service dependencies
   - Potential for circular dependencies
   - Challenge in maintaining consistency across services
   
2. **Design System Consistency**
   - Ensuring consistent implementation across all modules
   - Maintaining accessibility with custom components
   - Handling responsive design for complex layouts
   - Ensuring dark mode works correctly across all interfaces

3. **Authentication Challenges**
   - Secure implementation of JWT
   - Proper handling of token refresh
   - Role-based permission enforcement
   
4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Efficient database schema design needed
   - Potentially large datasets for statistics
   - Real-time communication scaling
   
5. **Internationalization Complexity**
   - Managing translations across many components
   - Date and number formatting by locale
   - Right-to-left language support (future)

## Next Milestones

1. **Milestone 1: Design System & Project Setup** (Target: 2 weeks)
   - Complete repository structure
   - Implement design system (Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui)
   - Create core UI components based on HockeyAppUIComponents.tsx
   - Configure dark mode and internationalization
   
2. **Milestone 2: User Management** (Target: 3 weeks)
   - Authentication system working
   - Role-based access control implemented
   - Team and user relationships established
   - Basic frontend with authentication
   
3. **Milestone 3: Calendar & Training Base** (Target: 4 weeks)
