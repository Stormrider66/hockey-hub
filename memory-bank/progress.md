## Known Issues / Risks

1. **Inter-Service Communication:** The current simulated API calls in `authzService` need replacement. Performance/reliability of synchronous calls vs. complexity of async events needs evaluation.
2. **Authorization Complexity:** Implementing granular permissions based on roles and relationships (coach-team-player, parent-child) across services requires careful design and testing.
3. **TODO Implementation:** Several core logic pieces (intensity calc, conflict detection) are still placeholders.
4. **Frontend Completeness:** Significant work remains to build out the different modules in the UI.
5. **Data Consistency:** Ensuring data integrity across service boundaries.
6. **Startup Order (Local Dev):** While retry logic helps, the fundamental dependency requires Docker Compose or similar for robust startup orchestration in production.

## Next Milestones

1. **Milestone: Backend Core Logic & Refinement** (Target: 3-4 weeks)
   - Implement core TODOs (Intensity Calc, Resource Conflicts).
   - Implement real authorization helper logic (`authzService.ts`).
   - Add Zod validation to remaining Planning/Training/Medical endpoints.
   - Implement remaining basic CRUD in scaffolded services.
   - Set up API Gateway routing for implemented services.

2. **Milestone: Foundational Frontend** (Target: 3-4 weeks remaining)
   - âœ… Implement basic Calendar UI (fetching/displaying events).
   - Connect Auth flow to User Service (Configure Providers).
   - Build core layout components using shadcn/ui (Refinement).
   - Implement basic Chat UI (listing chats, displaying messages).

3. **Milestone: Training Module Frontend & Core Features** (Target: 4 weeks)
   - UI for Exercise Library, Templates.
   - UI for Scheduling Sessions (integrating intensity calc).
   - UI for Test Definitions & Results entry.

## Implementation Timeline

(Timeline remains roughly the same, but progress within phases updated)
