# Hockey Hub - Progress

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Feature Integration & Stabilization
**Overall Completion**: ~60%
**Current Focus**: Stabilizing the Planning Service backend and completing the Medical Staff dashboard UI.

## What's Been Completed
The project has made substantial progress, moving from foundational setup to implementing and integrating core features.

### âœ… **Core Infrastructure & Architecture**
-   **End-to-End Authentication**: A complete, stable, and secure authentication system is operational, from frontend login to JWT validation in the API Gateway and downstream services. [[memory:8507756843175672381]] [[memory:4045275568113935009]]
-   **Comprehensive Observability Stack**: A production-grade monitoring solution is fully deployed, including Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and the ELK stack for centralized logging, metrics, and distributed tracing. [[memory:6384293909347582517]]
-   **Hardened Security Posture**: Resolved 15 critical security vulnerabilities, implementing platform-wide protections against SSRF, path traversal, XSS, and insecure randomness. [[memory:1408181784522788330]]
-   **Stable Development Environment**: The full local development environment is operational, with all core services, databases, and infrastructure running reliably via Docker Compose. [[memory:8071179957871205476]]
-   **Event-Driven Architecture**: NATS is implemented as the central event bus for asynchronous communication between microservices.
-   **Monorepo with CI/CD**: The project is structured as a `turbo` monorepo with robust GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and linting.

### âœ… **Service & Feature Implementation**
-   **User Service**: Fully implemented with user/team CRUD, role-based access control, and JWT management.
-   **Medical Service (Backend)**: 100% complete. Features full CRUD for injuries, treatments, and updates, with S3 integration for document uploads and a fully resolved database connection. [[memory:4774941026916976904]] [[memory:5747803406406488166]]
-   **Medical Service (Frontend - Partial)**: The first fully integrated dashboard feature, the **Enhanced Injury Detail Modal**, is complete and connected to the live backend. A complete Treatment Management System with an Exercise library is also integrated and functional. [[memory:8575056704038898426]] [[memory:5926281153998843226]]
-   **Planning Service (Backend - Partial)**: ~90% of business logic is implemented (Seasons, Goals, Development Plans) with a passing test suite. Currently blocked by runtime issues. [[memory:248097510482242080]]
-   **API Gateway**: Successfully routing traffic to integrated services, handling authentication, and configured to prevent CORS issues.

## What's In Progress

-   **ðŸ”„ Stabilizing Planning Service**: The highest priority is debugging the 500 Internal Server Errors that are making the service non-operational.
-   **ðŸ”„ Completing Medical Staff Dashboard**: Ongoing UI/UX work to connect remaining functionality (~50% of controls) to backend APIs and improve the overall workflow for medical staff. [[memory:5587306593636521338]]
-   **ðŸ”„ Progressive Integration of Other Services**: Preparing the Calendar and Training services for the next wave of integration.

## What's Left to Build
While the foundation is strong, several key services and features are still in earlier stages of development.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
-   âœ… Calendar Service (Backend foundations exist, requires integration)
-   âœ… Communication Service (Backend foundations exist, requires integration)
-   âœ… Training Service (Backend foundations exist, requires integration)
-   â¬œ **Frontend integration for the above services**

### Phase 3: Extended Functionality
-   âœ… Medical Service (Backend Complete, Frontend ~80% complete)
-   ðŸ”„ Planning Service (Backend ~90% complete, requires debugging)
-   â¬œ Statistics Service (Skeleton only, requires full implementation)
-   â¬œ **Frontend integration for Planning and Statistics services**

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
-   â¬œ Payment Service (Skeleton only, requires Stripe integration)
-   â¬œ Admin Service (Partially implemented, requires significant work)
-   â¬œ AI-Assisted Features (Prototyped, requires integration)
-   â¬œ **Frontend for Payment and Admin services**

### Phase 5 & 6: Refinement & Finalization
-   â¬œ External integrations beyond S3
-   â¬œ Advanced analytics and reporting dashboards
-   â¬œ Comprehensive performance and security auditing
-   â¬œ Finalized user and administrator documentation

## Known Issues

1.  **CRITICAL: Planning Service is Down**
    -   **Description**: All endpoints for the `planning-service` are returning 500 Internal Server Errors, completely blocking backend functionality and any further frontend integration.
    -   **Impact**: This is the primary blocker for progressing on the planning and periodization features.
    -   **Status**: Actively being investigated. Suspected causes are database connection or configuration issues. [[memory:248097510482242080]]

2.  **High Priority: Medical Dashboard Incomplete**
    -   **Description**: The Medical Staff Dashboard is not yet feature-complete. Around 50% of the UI controls are not connected to the backend, and the overall user experience needs refinement.
    -   **Impact**: The dashboard cannot be handed over to medical staff for testing or use.
    -   **Status**: Actively in development. [[memory:5587306593636521338]]
