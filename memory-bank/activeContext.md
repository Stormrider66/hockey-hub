# Hockey Hub - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The project has moved beyond initial setup and is now focused on service integration, backend stabilization, and frontend feature completion. The two primary areas of focus are:

1.  **Stabilizing the Planning Service Backend**
    *   The Planning Service backend is ~90% complete in terms of feature implementation (seasons, goals, development plans) and has a comprehensive test suite.
    *   However, it is currently non-functional due to a critical runtime issue causing all endpoints to return 500 Internal Server Errors.
    *   The immediate priority is to diagnose and resolve this issue, which is suspected to be related to database connectivity or schema mismatches. [[memory:248097510482242080]]

2.  **Completing the Medical Staff Dashboard UI/UX**
    *   While the Medical Service backend is 100% complete and integrated [[memory:4774941026916976904]], the corresponding frontend dashboard requires significant work.
    *   The focus is on implementing the remaining functionality (approximately 50% of buttons are not yet wired up) and refining the user experience based on initial feedback and design guidelines. [[memory:5587306593636521338]]
    *   This involves integrating the remaining API endpoints for treatments, wellness, and player availability.

## Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Debug Planning Service**:
    *   **Action**: Investigate the 500 Internal Server Errors on the Planning Service.
    *   **Plan**: Check database connection strings, verify environment variables (`.env`), inspect logs from the service, and ensure all necessary database tables and schemas have been created and migrated correctly.
    *   **Goal**: Get the `/health` endpoint and core CRUD endpoints to return 200/201 status codes.

2.  **Halt Planning Service Frontend Integration**:
    *   **Action**: All frontend work for the Planning Service is on hold.
    *   **Reason**: It is inefficient to proceed with frontend development until the backend API is stable and returning valid data. [[memory:248097510482242080]]

3.  **Continue Medical Dashboard Implementation**:
    *   **Action**: Continue building out the UI components and data hooks for the Medical Staff Dashboard.
    *   **Plan**: Connect the "Add Treatment" and other inactive UI elements to their respective backend APIs, following the established pattern from the Injury Detail Modal. [[memory:8575056704038898426]]

4.  **Prepare for Calendar Service Integration**:
    *   **Action**: Begin preliminary review of the Calendar Service to prepare it for the next phase of integration work once the Planning Service is stable.
    *   **Plan**: Review existing routes, entities, and services to identify any gaps.

## Active Blockers & Issues

*   **CRITICAL BLOCKER**: **Planning Service is non-operational.** All attempts to integrate the frontend are blocked until the backend 500 errors are resolved. This is the highest priority issue for the backend team. [[memory:248097510482242080]]
*   **High Priority Issue**: **Medical Dashboard is incomplete.** The dashboard is not yet ready for user testing by medical staff due to partially implemented features and UX gaps. [[memory:5587306593636521338]]
*   **Resolved Issue (For Reference)**: Frontend authentication issues were previously caused by stale tokens in `localStorage`. The resolution is to clear `localStorage` for the application and log in again. This should be the first step for any future authentication problems on the frontend. [[memory:8071179957871205476]]

## Key Decisions & Architectural Points of Interest

1.  **Progressive Integration Pattern**: The successful integration of the Medical Service has proven the "progressive integration" pattern: build UI against mock data, then switch to real API calls using feature flags. This pattern will be used for all subsequent service integrations. [[memory:6640872325499110337]]

2.  **Observability Stack is Production-Ready**: The complete monitoring and observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, ELK) is operational and ready for use. All new and existing services should be integrated with this stack for logging, metrics, and tracing. [[memory:6384293909347582517]]

3.  **Security Posture is Hardened**: A major security effort has resolved 15 critical vulnerabilities. Key patterns like SSRF protection, rate limiting, and use of cryptographically secure random numbers are now part of the codebase and must be maintained. [[memory:1408181784522788330]]

4.  **Authentication is Stable**: The end-to-end authentication flow, from frontend login to JWT validation at the API Gateway and downstream services, is fully functional and stable. This serves as a reliable foundation for all role-based access control. [[memory:8507756843175672381]]

This document reflects the current state of the Hockey Hub project, with a focus on stabilizing the backend and completing in-progress features.
