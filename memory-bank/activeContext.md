## Current Work Focus

**Primary Focus**: Medical Dashboard Button Integration - Authentication Fixed âœ… (June 14, 2025)
**System Status**: Complete Authentication System + Medical Backend Integration Enabled
**Next Priority**: Complete Medical Dashboard Button Endpoints (10+ buttons need backend connections)

## Recent Major Achievement

### ðŸŽ‰ AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM COMPLETE + MEDICAL BACKEND INTEGRATION (June 14, 2025)

**Hockey Hub authentication is now fully operational** with complete end-to-end integration AND medical backend enabled:

1. **âœ… Complete Authentication Flow Working**:
   - Login successful with medical@saik.se
   - JWT tokens properly generated and validated
   - API Gateway forwarding authentication headers correctly
   - User profile endpoint `/api/v1/users/me` returning 200 status
   - Medical staff dashboard accessible at `http://localhost:3002/medicalstaff`

2. **âœ… All Technical Issues Resolved**:
   - Fixed TypeORM column type errors in Payment Service
   - Implemented proper JWT forwarding in API Gateway 
   - Corrected route mapping (`/users/me` vs `/auth/me`)
   - Set Turbo concurrency to 15 for all persistent tasks
   - Added medical_staff role to authorization middleware

3. **âœ… Real Backend Integration Successful**:
   - No more mock data needed for authentication
   - Real user data from PostgreSQL database
   - Microservices architecture working properly
   - Cross-service communication through API Gateway verified

4. **âœ… CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION BUG FIXED (June 14, 2025)**:
   - **Root Cause Identified**: User Service had duplicate login handlers - authRoutes.ts was only returning user data while setting tokens as cookies
   - **Solution Implemented**: Modified authRoutes.ts to return tokens in both response body AND cookies
   - **Result**: Frontend now receives `{ accessToken, refreshToken, user }` in response body as expected
   - **Status**: Login working perfectly with medical@saik.se (Anna Eriksson, Medical Staff)

5. **âœ… Medical Backend Integration Enabled**:
   - Feature flag `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MEDICAL=true` activated
   - Medical Service (port 3005) fully operational with real injury data
   - Progressive integration pattern working (real data when available, mock fallback)
   - All major medical dashboard components ready for real API connections

## What Just Completed

- âœ… **End-to-End Authentication**: Login â†’ API Gateway â†’ User Service â†’ Database
- âœ… **Route Resolution**: Frontend calling correct `/users/me` endpoint  
- âœ… **JWT Token Management**: Proper generation, validation, and forwarding
- âœ… **CORS Configuration**: Correct origin settings for frontend-backend communication
- âœ… **Role Authorization**: Medical staff role properly included in access control
- âœ… **Medical Dashboard Access**: Full dashboard loading with real authentication

## Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

### Phase 1 Backend Integration Priority

1. **Medical Dashboard Button Integration** (Week 1 - URGENT):
   - **10+ buttons identified** that need backend endpoint connections
   - Connect remaining medical dashboard buttons to real Medical Service APIs
   - Implement missing endpoints for buttons without backend functionality
   - Test complete medical workflow with authenticated users
   - Priority: Treatment scheduling, injury updates, medical analytics

2. **Complete Medical Service Integration** (Week 1):
   - Verify all injury CRUD operations working with real data
   - Test document upload/download with S3 integration
   - Validate player availability management with real APIs
   - Ensure all medical dashboard tabs fully functional

3. **Additional Dashboard Integration** (Week 2):
   - Connect Planning Service for season and development data
   - Integrate Calendar Service for real event management
   - Expand to other role-based dashboards (Coach, Player, etc.)

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Integration Strategy
- **Progressive Approach**: Start with most complete services (Medical, Planning, User)
- **Feature Flags**: Maintain both mock and real data paths during transition
- **Service Priority**: Focus on 90% complete services first
- **Risk Mitigation**: Keep fallback mechanisms until integration is stable

### Technical Approach
- **Authentication Foundation**: Proven JWT system ready for expansion
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket infrastructure available for live updates
- **Performance Monitoring**: Watch response times as real data integration increases
- **Error Handling**: Ensure graceful degradation during backend integration

## Recent Changes & Context

### Authentication Breakthrough
- Complete end-to-end authentication working in browser
- Real user authentication with medical@saik.se account
- JWT token lifecycle properly managed
- Cross-service communication through API Gateway verified
- Medical dashboard fully accessible and functional

### System Architecture Proven
- All 11 services operational and communicating properly
- Database connectivity confirmed across all services
- Frontend-backend integration successful
- Microservices architecture working as designed

### Development Environment Stable
- All compilation errors resolved
- Port conflicts eliminated
- Service startup issues fixed
- Test infrastructure passing

## Known Constraints & Blockers

### None Currently Active âœ…
- Authentication system complete and operational
- All major technical blockers resolved
- Service communication verified
- Database connectivity confirmed

### Monitoring Points
- **Performance**: Monitor response times as real data integration increases
- **Memory Usage**: Watch service memory consumption with actual database loads
- **Error Handling**: Ensure graceful degradation during backend integration
- **User Experience**: Maintain dashboard responsiveness during data source transitions

## Success Metrics & Goals

### Immediate Success Criteria (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Medical Service integrated with real injury and treatment data
- [ ] User profiles displaying actual user information in dashboards
- [ ] Real logout functionality implemented
- [ ] Feature flags operational for gradual rollout

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria (4-6 weeks)
- [ ] All 90% complete services (Medical, Planning, User) fully integrated
- [ ] Real-time updates working for medical and training features
- [ ] Complete medical team workflow functional with real data
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges

### MVP Readiness Criteria (8-10 weeks)
- [ ] All core services integrated and stable
- [ ] Coach and player dashboards connected to real data
- [ ] System ready for limited production use with real hockey teams
- [ ] End-to-end workflows tested and documented

## Development Workflow

### Current Development Pattern
- Build components in Storybook with MSW mocks (continue for new features)
- Progressively integrate existing features with real backend APIs
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of integrated features
- Maintain both mock and real data paths until integration is stable

### Integration Approach
- Start with most complete backend services
- Test thoroughly before removing mock data paths
- Implement proper error boundaries for graceful degradation
- Monitor performance and user experience during transitions

This represents the successful completion of the authentication foundation and the beginning of comprehensive backend integration for a production-ready hockey management platform.
