# Conditioning Workout Builder - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive conditioning workout builder for the Physical Trainer dashboard in Hockey Hub. This system enables trainers to create interval-based cardio workouts with personalized targets based on player test results.

## ‚úÖ Components Implemented

### 1. **Type Definitions** (`conditioning.types.ts`)
- `WorkoutEquipmentType` enum with 8 equipment types (Running, Rowing, SkiErg, BikeErg, Wattbike, AirBike, Rope Jump, Treadmill)
- `IntervalSet` interface for defining workout intervals
- `IntervalProgram` interface for complete workout programs
- `PlayerTestResult` interface for fitness test data
- `PersonalizedInterval` interface for player-specific targets
- Equipment configurations with specific metrics per equipment type

### 2. **ConditioningWorkoutBuilder Component**
Main component providing:
- **Build Tab**: Drag-and-drop interval timeline builder
- **Templates Tab**: Pre-built workout templates (HIIT, Steady State, Pyramid, FTP Test)
- **Personalize Tab**: Test-based target personalization
- Visual workout summary with zone distribution
- Real-time duration and calorie estimation

### 3. **IntervalForm Component**
Comprehensive interval configuration:
- Duration input (minutes and seconds)
- Interval type selection (Warmup, Work, Rest, Active Recovery, Cooldown)
- Target type selection (Absolute, Percentage of Test, Zone)
- Equipment-specific targets:
  - Heart Rate (BPM or % of max/threshold)
  - Power/Watts (for cycling equipment)
  - Pace (for rowing/running)
  - RPM (for cycling)
  - Calories
- Notes/instructions field

### 4. **IntervalTimeline Component**
Visual workout builder with:
- Drag-and-drop interval reordering
- Visual timeline with proportional interval display
- Color-coded interval types
- Quick actions (edit, duplicate, delete)
- Real-time workout duration display

### 5. **TestBasedTargets Component**
Player personalization features:
- Display player test results (Max HR, Lactate Threshold, FTP, VO2max)
- Calculate personalized targets based on test data
- Multiple player support with tabs
- Visual calculation display
- Warning for players without test data

### 6. **ConditioningIntervalDisplay Component**
Enhanced session viewer for conditioning workouts:
- Real-time interval display with countdown timer
- Target vs actual metrics comparison
- Heart rate zone tracking
- Audio cues for interval changes
- Session progress tracking
- Interval execution recording for statistics

### 7. **Supporting Components**
- **EquipmentSelector**: Visual equipment type selection
- **WorkoutSummary**: Real-time workout statistics
- **WorkoutTemplateLibrary**: Pre-built template browser

## üîå Integration Points

### SessionsTab Integration
- Added "Conditioning" button to launch the workout builder
- Saves conditioning workouts as session templates
- Converts interval programs to session template format

### TrainingSessionViewer Support
- Existing interval timer support can display basic conditioning workouts
- Enhanced `ConditioningIntervalDisplay` available for full features

## üìä Data Model

### Interval Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  type: 'warmup' | 'work' | 'rest' | 'active_recovery' | 'cooldown';
  duration: number; // seconds
  equipment: WorkoutEquipmentType;
  targetMetrics: {
    heartRate?: TargetMetric;
    watts?: TargetMetric;
    pace?: TargetMetric;
    // ... other metrics
  };
}
```

### Target Metrics
- **Absolute**: Direct values (e.g., 150 BPM, 200W)
- **Percentage**: Based on test results (e.g., 80% of FTP)
- **Zone**: Training zones (1-5)

## üéØ Features

### Workout Creation
1. Select equipment type
2. Add intervals with specific targets
3. Configure work/rest periods
4. Set personalized targets based on player tests
5. Save as reusable template

### Pre-built Templates
- **20-Minute HIIT**: 30s work/30s rest intervals
- **30-Minute Steady State**: Aerobic base building
- **Pyramid Intervals**: Progressive 1-2-3-2-1 minute intervals
- **FTP Test**: 20-minute test protocol

### Player Personalization
- Links to player test results (VO2max, Lactate Threshold, FTP, Max HR)
- Calculates individual targets for each player
- Shows warnings for players without test data
- Supports bulk assignment to teams

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Create Workout**
   - Click "Conditioning" button in Sessions tab
   - Build intervals using drag-and-drop
   - Configure targets for each interval

2. **Personalize**
   - Select players or teams
   - System calculates personalized targets
   - Review and adjust as needed

3. **Save & Schedule**
   - Save as template for reuse
   - Schedule via calendar integration
   - Assign to players/teams

4. **Execute**
   - Players view in TrainingSessionViewer
   - Real-time interval display with targets
   - Audio/visual cues for interval changes
   - Automatic data collection

5. **Track Progress**
   - Integration with statistics service
   - Performance tracking over time
   - Goal achievement analysis

## üöÄ Next Steps

### ‚úÖ Backend Support (COMPLETED - January 2025)
- Extended WorkoutSession entity with intervalProgram JSONB field
- Created database migration (1736400000000-AddIntervalProgramToWorkoutSession)
- Added IntervalProgramDto and related DTOs to shared-lib
- Updated CachedWorkoutSessionService to handle intervalProgram
- Added conditioning-specific API endpoints:
  - GET /sessions/conditioning - fetch interval workouts
  - POST /sessions/conditioning/convert - convert to exercises
  - GET /sessions/conditioning/templates - get templates

### Remaining Integration Tasks
1. **Calendar Service Integration** (In Progress)
   - Add intervalProgram field to calendar events
   - Display workout preview in calendar
   - Show equipment requirements in calendar view

2. **Statistics Service Integration**
   - Create CardioWorkoutExecution entity
   - Track interval completion and target achievement
   - Generate progress reports
   - Real-time metrics collection

## üìù Usage Example

```typescript
// Creating a conditioning workout
const hiitWorkout: IntervalProgram = {
  name: "20-Min HIIT Rowing",
  equipment: WorkoutEquipmentType.ROWING,
  intervals: [
    {
      type: 'warmup',
      duration: 300,
      targetMetrics: { heartRate: { type: 'percentage', value: 60, reference: 'max' } }
    },
    // ... work/rest intervals
  ],
  totalDuration: 1200,
  estimatedCalories: 250
};
```
