## üìä Current Status

### Fully Implemented ‚úÖ
1. **Conditioning Workouts** - 100% complete with interval programming
2. **Hybrid Workouts** - Builder and display components complete
3. **Agility Workouts** - Builder and display components complete
4. **Mock Data** - Comprehensive test data for all workout types
5. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage

### Remaining Tasks
1. **Backend API Integration** - Wire up save/load functionality
2. **User Flow Testing** - End-to-end testing of all workflows
3. **Calendar Integration Testing** - Verify workout scheduling
4. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure smooth animations

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Physical Trainer Flow
1. Navigate to Physical Trainer dashboard
2. Click "Sessions" tab
3. Choose workout type:
   - "Conditioning" ‚Üí Interval-based cardio
   - "Hybrid" ‚Üí Mixed strength and cardio
   - "Agility" ‚Üí Drill-based agility training
4. Build workout using visual builders
5. Save and assign to players/teams

### Player Flow
