## Test Administration Guidelines

1. **Testing frequency**: Conduct full battery 3-4 times per year (pre-season, mid-season, post-season)
2. **Testing order**: Always follow the same order:
   - Anthropometrics
   - Aerobic capacity (if not done on separate day)
   - Speed & power
   - Strength
   - On-ice tests
3. **Rest periods**: Ensure adequate rest between attempts (30s-1min for jumps, 3-5min for sprints and maximal strength tests)
4. **Environment**: Maintain consistent testing conditions (same time of day, similar temperature, etc.)
5. **Instructions**: Provide clear, standardized instructions for all tests
6. **Motivation**: Ensure consistent verbal encouragement across all tests and participants
7. **Recording**: Enter data immediately after each test to avoid recording errors
8. **Custom tests**: Follow similar standardization principles when adding new tests to battery
9. **Proper warm-up**: Ensure all athletes complete a standardized warm-up before testing
10. **Testing staff**: Train all staff on proper testing procedures to ensure reliability
11. **Equipment calibration**: Regularly calibrate all measurement devices before testing sessions

## Data Collection Guidelines

For each test, record the following information:
- Player ID and demographic information
- Test date and time
- Testing conditions (temperature, humidity if relevant)
- Equipment used (including model numbers for standardization)
- Raw test results (all attempts, not just best)
- Any modifications to standard protocol (if necessary)
- Notes on technique or limitations that may affect results
- Administrator name for quality control
