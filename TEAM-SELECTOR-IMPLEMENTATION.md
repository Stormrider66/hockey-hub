# Team Selector Implementation - Complete Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of team-aware calendar functionality across Medical Staff, Club Admin, and Ice Coach dashboards in Hockey Hub. The implementation allows different roles to filter their view by specific teams, improving focus and reducing information overload.

## üéØ Implementation Summary

### What Was Implemented

1. **Shared Team Selection Hook** (`useTeamSelection`)
   - Centralized team selection logic with localStorage persistence
   - Configurable options for different roles
   - Automatic default selection handling

2. **Team Selector Component Integration**
   - Medical Staff Dashboard: Can view all teams or specific teams
   - Club Admin Dashboard: Can view all teams or specific teams
   - Ice Coach Dashboard: Focused on assigned teams only (no "All Teams" option)

3. **Calendar Integration**
   - All calendar views now accept and use teamId parameter
   - Mock data supports team-aware filtering
   - Consistent filtering across all role dashboards

4. **Internationalization**
   - Team selector translations moved to common namespace
   - Consistent labeling across all dashboards

## üîß Technical Details

### useTeamSelection Hook

```typescript
interface UseTeamSelectionOptions {
  storageKey: string;
  defaultTeamId?: string;
  includeAllOption?: boolean;
  includePersonalOption?: boolean;
}

// Usage examples:
// Medical Staff - can see all teams
const { selectedTeamId, setSelectedTeamId, teams } = useTeamSelection({
  storageKey: 'medicalStaff_selectedTeamId',
  includeAllOption: true,
  includePersonalOption: false
});

// Ice Coach - focused on specific teams
const { selectedTeamId, setSelectedTeamId, teams } = useTeamSelection({
  storageKey: 'iceCoach_selectedTeamId',
  includeAllOption: false,
  includePersonalOption: false
});
```

### Local Storage Keys
- Medical Staff: `medicalStaff_selectedTeamId`
- Club Admin: `clubAdmin_selectedTeamId`
- Ice Coach: `iceCoach_selectedTeamId`
- Physical Trainer: `physicalTrainer_selectedTeamId` (already existed)

### Calendar Integration Pattern

Each dashboard's calendar view now accepts a teamId prop:

```typescript
// Medical Staff Calendar
<MedicalCalendarView teamId={isAllTeams ? undefined : selectedTeamId} />

// Club Admin Calendar
<ClubAdminCalendarView teamId={isAllTeams ? undefined : selectedTeamId} />

// Ice Coach Calendar
<IceCoachCalendarView teamId={selectedTeamId || "team-senior"} />
```

## üé® UI/UX Behavior

### Team Selector Placement
- Positioned between dashboard header and tabs
- Consistent placement across all dashboards
- Uses same visual style as Physical Trainer dashboard

### Selection Behavior
1. **All Teams** (Medical Staff, Club Admin only)
   - Shows data from all teams in the organization
   - Calendar displays all events across teams
   - Globe icon indicator

2. **Specific Team**
   - Filters all data to selected team only
   - Calendar shows team-specific events
   - Users icon indicator

3. **Personal View** (Physical Trainer only)
   - Shows individual training sessions
   - User icon indicator

### Persistence
- Team selection persists across page refreshes
- Each role maintains independent selection
- Defaults to first available team if no selection exists

## üìä Mock Data Support

The mock data system (`mockBaseQuery.ts`) already supports team filtering:

```typescript
// Calendar events are generated per team
const generateTeamEvents = (teamId?: string) => {
  // Returns team-specific events with appropriate titles
  // e.g., "A-Team vs Rivals HC" or "J20 Ice Practice"
};

// Supported team IDs:
- 'a-team': A-Team
- 'j20': J20
- 'u18': U18
- 'u16': U16
- 'womens': Women's Team
```

## üåê Translations

Team selector translations are now in the common namespace:

```json
{
  "teamSelector": {
    "team": "Team",
    "selectTeam": "Select Team",
    "allTeams": "All Teams",
    "personal": "Personal View"
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

1. **Role-Based Team Access**
   - Implement backend logic to restrict teams based on user permissions
   - Ice coaches should only see their assigned teams in the dropdown

2. **Multi-Team Selection**
   - Allow selection of multiple teams simultaneously
   - Useful for comparing schedules across teams

3. **Team Groups**
   - Group teams by category (Senior, Junior, Youth)
   - Hierarchical selection options

4. **Quick Team Switch**
   - Keyboard shortcuts for team switching
   - Recent teams quick access

5. **Team-Specific Defaults**
   - Remember last viewed tab per team
   - Team-specific dashboard layouts

## üìã Testing Checklist

- [x] Team selection persists across page refreshes
- [x] Calendar events filter correctly by team
- [x] "All Teams" option shows events from multiple teams
- [x] Ice Coach dashboard doesn't show "All Teams" option
- [x] Team selector appears in consistent location
- [x] Translations work correctly
- [x] Mock data generates team-specific events
- [x] No console errors or warnings

## üéØ Success Metrics

The implementation successfully achieves:
1. **Improved Focus**: Users can concentrate on their specific team(s)
2. **Reduced Clutter**: Less information overload from irrelevant team data
3. **Consistent UX**: Same interaction pattern across all dashboards
4. **Flexible Configuration**: Each role can have different options
5. **Performance**: Efficient filtering without additional API calls
