# Phase 5: Advanced Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 5 focused on implementing advanced calendar features including recurring events, calendar export functionality, and laying the groundwork for notifications and analytics.

## Completed Features

### 1. Recurring Events (Backend) ✅
Created a comprehensive recurring event system with full backend support:

#### RecurringEventProcessor Service
- **File**: `/services/calendar-service/src/services/recurringEventProcessor.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Generate recurring event instances based on recurrence rules
  - Support for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly patterns
  - Custom intervals (e.g., every 2 weeks)
  - Week day selection for weekly patterns
  - Month day selection for monthly patterns
  - Exception date handling
  - Count-based or end-date-based termination
  - RRULE string support (placeholder for future rrule library integration)
  - Single instance updates with exception events
  - Future instance updates with series splitting
  - Validation for recurrence rules

#### EventService Updates
- Added `createRecurringEvent` method
- Added `getRecurringEventInstances` method
- Added `updateRecurringEventInstance` method with support for:
  - Single instance updates
  - Future instance updates
  - All instances updates
- Added `deleteRecurringEventInstance` method with support for:
  - Single instance deletion
  - Future instance deletion
  - Series deletion
- Human-readable recurrence description generation

#### API Routes
- POST `/events/recurring` - Create recurring events
- GET `/events/:id/instances` - Get recurring event instances for date range
- PUT `/events/:id/instances/:instanceDate` - Update recurring instance
- DELETE `/events/:id/instances/:instanceDate` - Delete recurring instance

### 2. Recurring Events (Frontend) ✅
Updated frontend to support recurring event creation:

#### Calendar API Updates
- Added `RecurrenceRule` interface
- Added recurring event fields to `CalendarEvent` interface
- Added `createRecurringEvent` mutation
- Added `getRecurringInstances` query
- Added `updateRecurringInstance` mutation
- Added `deleteRecurringInstance` mutation

#### CreateEventModal Updates
- Integrated `RecurrenceSettings` component
- Added logic to use recurring event endpoint when recurrence is enabled
- Proper data transformation for recurrence rules

### 3. Calendar Export Functionality ✅
Implemented comprehensive calendar export system:

#### CalendarExportService
- **File**: `/services/calendar-service/src/services/calendarExportService.ts`
- **Export Formats**:
  - **iCalendar (.ics)**: RFC-compliant format with:
    - Event details (title, description, location, time)
    - Recurrence rules (RRULE) generation
    - Exception dates (EXDATE)
    - Reminders (VALARM)
    - Status mapping
    - Categories based on event type
  - **CSV**: Spreadsheet-friendly format with:
    - Proper field escaping
    - All essential event fields
    - Easy import to Excel/Google Sheets
  - **HTML**: Print-ready format with:
    - Grouped by date
    - Styled for readability
    - Print-optimized CSS
    - Recurring event badges
    - Event type color coding

#### Export API Endpoints
- GET `/events/export/:format` - Export events in specified format
- GET `/events/subscribe` - Get calendar subscription URL
- GET `/events/feed/:format` - Calendar feed for subscriptions

#### Frontend Export Support
- Added export endpoints to calendarApi
- Created `useCalendarExport` hook for easy export functionality
- Automatic file download handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### 4. Calendar Subscription Support ✅
Implemented calendar subscription functionality:
- Subscription URL generation
- Instructions for major calendar apps (Google, Apple, Outlook)
- Token-based authentication (placeholder)
- Auto-updating calendar feeds
- 5-minute cache for performance

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Full TypeScript support throughout
- Proper error handling
- Validation for all inputs
- Consistent API patterns

### Performance
- Efficient recurrence generation
- Pagination support for large event sets
- Caching headers for subscription feeds

### User Experience
- Human-readable recurrence descriptions
- Clear error messages
- Multiple export format options
- Easy calendar subscription setup

## What's Ready for Production

1. **Recurring Events**: Full backend implementation with instance management
2. **Calendar Export**: All three formats (iCal, CSV, HTML) working
3. **Subscription URLs**: Basic implementation ready, needs auth token system

## What Still Needs Work

1. **RRULE Library**: Need to install and integrate rrule library for full RFC compliance
2. **Authentication**: Token validation for subscription URLs
3. **Notifications**: Email and push notification system
4. **Analytics**: Calendar usage and optimization dashboard
5. **PDF Export**: Convert HTML to PDF for better printing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Install rrule library and update RecurringEventProcessor
2. Implement notification service infrastructure
3. Add WebSocket support for real-time calendar updates

### Future Enhancements
1. Calendar analytics dashboard
2. Advanced recurrence patterns (e.g., "First Monday of month")
3. Timezone support for international teams
4. Calendar sharing with granular permissions
5. Event templates for quick creation

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Recurring Event
```typescript
const event = await createRecurringEvent({
  title: "Team Practice",
  type: EventType.TRAINING,
  startTime: "2025-07-01T16:00:00Z",
  endTime: "2025-07-01T18:00:00Z",
  recurrence: {
    frequency: "weekly",
    weekDays: [1, 3, 5], // Mon, Wed, Fri
    endDate: "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }
});
```

### Exporting Calendar
```typescript
const { exportCalendar } = useCalendarExport({
  organizationId: "org123",
  teamId: "team456"
});

// Export as iCal
await exportCalendar('ics');

// Export as CSV
await exportCalendar('csv');
```

### Getting Subscription URL
```typescript
const { data } = useGetSubscriptionUrlQuery({
  organizationId: "org123",
  userId: "user789",
  token: "secret-token"
});

// Returns URL and instructions for calendar apps
```

## Summary
Phase 5 successfully implemented the core advanced features for the Hockey Hub calendar system. Recurring events are fully functional with comprehensive management options. Calendar export works in multiple formats, and subscription URLs enable auto-updating calendars in external apps. The foundation is now set for the remaining features like notifications and analytics.
