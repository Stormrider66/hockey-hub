2. **Beta Release**: Add communication features
3. **Production**: Full feature set with payments

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Auth Failures**: Implement fallback to email/password if SSO fails
- **File Upload Issues**: Queue uploads for retry, show clear errors
- **Payment Failures**: Graceful degradation, maintain service access
- **Real-time Disconnects**: Fallback to polling, queue messages
- **Email Delivery**: Multiple provider fallback, delivery monitoring

### Phase 5 Key Decisions Summary:

#### Recommended Technology Choices:
1. **Authentication**:
   - Use httpOnly cookies for JWT storage (most secure)
   - Implement refresh tokens with rotation
   - Start with email/password, prepare for SSO later
   - Add MFA with authenticator apps (more secure than SMS)

2. **File Storage**:
   - AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN (mature, well-documented)
   - Use Sharp for image processing (faster than ImageMagick)
   - Implement virus scanning for security
   - Signed URLs for access control

3. **Communication**:
   - SendGrid for transactional emails (better deliverability)
   - Twilio for SMS (most reliable)
   - Redis Pub/Sub for real-time (already using Redis)
   - Service Workers for push notifications

4. **Payment**:
   - Stripe for payments (better developer experience)
   - Implement webhook queue with Bull
   - Use Stripe's hosted checkout for PCI compliance
   - Start with single currency, add multi-currency later

#### Implementation Tips:
- Start each feature with the simplest working version
- Add complexity incrementally
- Write tests as you go (not after)
- Document architecture decisions
- Create feature flags for gradual rollout

// CORRECT:
import { createMockRequest, createMockResponse } from '@hockey-hub/shared-lib/src/testing/testHelpers';
```

#### Known Type Issues:
- AuthRequest interface mismatch between middleware and controllers
- Controller methods need to return Promise<Response> not void
- Import paths need to use `/dist/` for built shared-lib packages
