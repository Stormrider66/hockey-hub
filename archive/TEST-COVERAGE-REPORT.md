## Test Infrastructure Used

### From shared-lib Testing Utilities:
- **testHelpers.ts**: Mock request/response creation, JWT tokens
- **mockFactory.ts**: Consistent test data generation
- **testDatabase.ts**: In-memory database for unit tests

### Testing Patterns Implemented:
1. **AAA Pattern**: Arrange-Act-Assert for clarity
2. **Mock Isolation**: Each test fully isolated
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Null values, empty arrays, invalid data
4. **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, validation errors, not found
5. **Authorization**: Role-based access verification

## Key Testing Achievements

### 1. Data Integrity Testing
- Validation of all input data
- Foreign key relationship testing
- Soft delete handling
- Audit trail verification

### 2. Performance Testing
- Cache hit/miss scenarios
- Pagination efficiency
- Query optimization verification
- Bulk operation handling

### 3. Security Testing
- Authentication middleware verification
- Authorization role checking
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention

### 4. Integration Points
- Service-to-service communication
- Notification system integration
- Cache invalidation cascades
- Transaction rollback scenarios

## Coverage Metrics (Estimated)

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests for a service
cd services/medical-service
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/routes/injuryRoutes.test.ts

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## Next Steps for Complete Coverage

1. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end API testing
   - Multi-service interaction tests
   - Database transaction tests

2. **Additional Services**
   - User Service (authentication flows)
   - Communication Service (notifications)
   - Statistics Service (analytics)

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Load testing with k6 or Artillery
   - Stress testing for concurrent users
   - Memory leak detection

4. **Security Tests**
   - Penetration testing
   - OWASP compliance
   - JWT token validation

## Benefits Achieved
