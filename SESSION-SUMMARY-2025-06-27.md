docker ps | grep hockeyhub_db
```

## Technical Notes

- Training service runs on port 3004
- WebSocket server included in training service
- Frontend connects to `http://localhost:3004` for Socket.io
- Each database has its own port (5432-5440)
- Mock data available when database is unavailable

Great progress today! The training system is now fully functional with real-time capabilities! ðŸŽ‰
